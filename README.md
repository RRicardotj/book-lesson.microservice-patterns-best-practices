# book-lesson.microservice-patterns-best-practices

Currentyly I am studying microservices and I am looking for a good way to learn them.
I've found that this book is a good way to learn them. This repo contains the source code of the book.

But I have to mentioned that all the code described in this repo IT IS NOT MINE. All the source code is from the book.

Also I have to say that it is almmost imposible to understand the porpuse of the code without reading the book.
So I encourage you to read buy it and start to reading it.
